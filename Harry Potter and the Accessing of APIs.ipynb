    "# Harry Potter and the Accessing of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate - through accessing the [Harry Potter API](https://www.potterapi.com/) - how to get data from APIs and some of the common steps that have to be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) is a service that provides data when asked for it. There are more specific and complex definitions, but that one is sufficient most of the time. APIs are designed to allow different machines and programs to speak to each other through code; there doesn't need to be a human in between. Most modern APIs use the [HTTP(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) protocol to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are everywhere - you can get [weather APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api), which allow you to get data on the weather. There are [Canadian football APIs](http://api.cfl.ca/), which provide data on Canadian football. There are APIs that will give you [love](http://www.loveaas.com/) or [hate](https://foaas.com/) or [placeholder images of kittens](https://placekitten.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs charge for access, but many allow either totally free access, or have several usage tiers so that you can experiment for free, but would be charged if - like many new tech companies - you wanted to build an entire business on top of existing APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone who uses the internet interacts with APIs every day - any time you see an interactive map, or see a list of products on a website, an API is probably being used in the background. Many modern organisations and companies are built on top of APIs provided by other organisations, and may provide APIs themselves. In short, APIs are everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing an API\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main pieces of information you need when attempting to use an API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Where to find the API (the **endpoint**)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How to make the request\n",
    "\n",
    "### API endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to request data from an API, you need to know where to send the request. An address that an API provides for people to make requests is called an **endpoint**. Some APIs have just one endpoint, responding to only one type of request. More usually, an API will have several different endpoints, each one allowing you to request different information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harry Potter API has a base address - `https://www.potterapi.com/v1/` and then several endpoints that extend from there. If you want, for example, to get a random Hogwarts house, you can use the sorting hat endpoint - `sortinghat` to make that request. The full address for the sorting hat endpoint is `https://www.potterapi.com/v1/sortinghat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because APIs communicate using HTTPS, the endpoint is a valid web address - or [URL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-url-2626035) - that you can access. Visiting that address will show you a randomly-chosen Hogwarts house.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Access the Harry Potter API sorting hat endpoint.](https://www.potterapi.com/v1/sortinghat)\n",
    "\n",
    "### API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, an API request is just the address of an API endpoint. Making an API call is when you access - or \"hit\" - an endpoint with a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link above lets you hit the `sortinghat` endpoint manually. From a human point of view, you click the link and visit another site. What's actually happening is that - when you click the link - your browser makes a request to the API endpoint, which gives back the data in [JSON format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), which your browser then displays for you. Most of the time, we don't need to think about the requests going back and forth across the internet, but it's helpful to be aware of them when talking about APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all requests are so simple. Some API endpoints listen out for extra information in requests, and return different data depending on the **parameters** you provide. Some endpoints require **authentication**, and will only return data to requests which contain a secret API key. We'll look at both of those further on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many APIs work in very similar ways, you'll always need to do a bit of research to work out exactly what the endpoints for a particular API are, or how requests should be formatted. Luckily, most APIs come with detailed documentation, including example requests and the data they would return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Harry Potter API's documentation](https://www.potterapi.com/) explains what each endpoint is for, and how to use it."

    "\n",
    "While it is possible to just visit API endpoints as a human user, it's not really what they're for. APIs are designed to be accessed using code, from within programs. We'll look now at how to use Python to access the `sortinghat` api endpoint.\n",
    "\n",

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation, and it is one of the most popular data formats in the world. It's a relatively lightweight format, it's human-readable, and it's easy to work with using most programming languages.\n",
